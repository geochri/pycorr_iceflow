# pycorr_iceflow

# Ice flow "feature" offset tracking in satellite images

## basic fuction
`pycorr_iceflow_1.1.py` is based on the approach described in [Rapid large-area mapping of ice flow using Landsat 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442571530211X) and the production code used for the [GoLIVE Landsat 8 processing](https://nsidc.org/data/golive) at NSIDC. It determines offsets at a user-specified grid spacing by comparing a square patch of pixels (a "chip") from an earlier image to the pixels in a larger square patch in a later image using the openCV cv2.matchTemplate function, a dft-based cross correlation which returns a correlation surface at integer pixel offsets between the two image chips.  Sub-pixel offset is determined by finding the peak of the spline of the correlation surface in the vicinity of the highest integer correlation peak.

## why pycorr?
pycorr is a "relatively" light weight python script that exploits [GDAL](https://gdal.org) and [openCV](https://opencv.org) to rapidly determine offsets in an image pair. Because it uses GDAL for image I/O, it can use image pairs in many geospatial formats, with the caveat that the images do overlap some spatially and that their image pixels have the same size. pycorr produces a netCDF4 file with offsets and correlation values at a user-specified grid resolution in the same projection as the original images **if** the input images are in a UTM or Antarctic Polar Stereo (epsg:3031) projection - this is the set of projections used for Landsat imagery.  If your images are in a a different projection, you are not out of luck - use the `-output_geotiffs_instead_of_netCDF` option to output in the same projection as the input images - this option allows any projection GDAL knows about, which is most.  The issue here is that the netCDF4 cf geolocation spec requires a variable block in the output file that is named after the projection, making it difficult to support all projections in a simple way.

There are a number of packages that provide similar analyses and may have more sophisticated approaches to identifying and filtering "noisy" matches, which can be due to cloud cover, surface change, low contrast features or an absence of features, shadows, and low signal-to-noise input imagery.  pycorr is intentionally simple - it does not use a series of larger chip sizes if the initial match fails to find a peak at a location; it returns a limited set of metrics that help document the uniqueness and strength of a peak that can be used to filter the output, but it does not attempt to provide an error estimate for each match.

pycorr is computationally fast because of the use of numpy and the openCV library, and so can process an image pair in minutes or tens of minutes depending on the image sizes and requested grid spacing and maximum offset specified for the search.  This process can be sped up by using land and ocean masks to limit search distances off of the ice and also by using reference ice flow speed maps to set search distances larger in fast flowing areas and smaller in slow flowing areas, but for simplest uses these are not applied.

## installation
The libraries required to run pycorr can be installed into a local environment with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) pulling from the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) repository:

### create environment - doesn't work anymore
Deprecated: At the time of first writing (5/5/2021) the current gdal in conda-forge (3.2.2) did not install python bindings properly - version 3.1.2 was specified here to avoid this issue.
```
 conda create --name test_pycorr_env -c conda-forge numpy matplotlib gdal netCDF4 psutil scipy opencv ipython fiona shapely pyproj boto3 git
```
### creating conda env with the right gdal version
```
 conda create --name pycorr_env -c conda-forge numpy matplotlib gdal=3.1.2 netCDF4 psutil scipy opencv ipython fiona shapely pyproj boto3

[-half_source_chip 10 specifies that a 20 x 20 pixel "chip" will be taken from each the grid pixel center]
[-half_target_chip 55   specifies a 110 x 110 pixel "chip" in the second image - search looks at every integer pixel offset 
                        of the source chip within the target chip, generating a correlation surface, and then reports the peak 
                        in the splined correlation surface at subpixel level (to 1/100th of a pixel)]

                        Note that maximum trackable offset in x or y is (half_target_chip - half_source_chip) * 
                        input_pixel_size_in_meters - so for this example (55 pixels - 10 pixels) * 10 m/pixel =

                                 land mask to use, then it builds a local land mask based on it and uses it for offset correction between 
                                 the two images - this makes the "land" chips have a 0 median offset, which provides an initial correction 
                                 for geolocation offset between the pair of images - very important for short time intervals]

## major sources of error
As a working point of reference the offsets determined in images of good quality over surfaces with recognizable features can be determined to 0.1 pixels or better. It is difficult to quantify this accuracy for any single match however. A sense of the background accuracy of the matching process for an image pair can be gained by looking at the scatter in the offsets determined for land pixels. Note that this scatter is likely similar for images separated in time by a few days or for a year - meaning that the same scatter would produce a much larger scatter in velocity determined from a few-day pair than from a pair with longer time separation. It is always a tradeoff to use longer pairs for accuracy if the ice you are studying has rapid variations in velocity over time - every image pair velocity field is a time-averaged displacement measurement.

A typical Landsat or Sentinel 2 satellite image has a geolocation accuracy that may be tens of meters - this can translate into an offset between two images of a few pixels.  This simple offset is the largest source of error in a velocity determination if the time interval between two images is short - a 15m (one pixel) offset for a 16-day Landsat 8 pair would result in a background "speed" over land of nearly 1 meter/day.  The same offset for an image pair that had a 365-day time separation would produce a background "speed" over land of a few cm/day.  For most slow flowing ice, if there is a significant amount of land visible in the imagery, one will want to use a land mask that can identify the non-ice pixels, so that the background offset can be removed at the time of processing.  This version of pycorr is able to use the global land masks that are presently online as part of the [ITS_LIVE project](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov), but this will require an internet connection at the time the code is run.  It is also possible to have your own local mask file - either a land(1)/glacier(0)/water(0) mask or a water(2)/land(1)/glacier(0) mask will work - it will be reprojected and sampled at the output grid resolution during processing. The second of these will also allow limiting search distances over water, speeding up processing.


A second common source of error is internal distortion in the satellite imagery because of limited accuracy in the surface elevation model used by the image provider to geolocate the pixels in the image. While many optical imagers take images from a near-nadir viewpoint, the width of the image swath is large enough that pixels near the edge of the swath are viewed from an angle off nadir - meaning that any error in an elevation model used to map those pixels to the surface of the Earth will mis-locate them relative to pixels in the image center.  If the ground location in question is to the right of the satellite on one pass, and to the left on an adjacent pass, then the topographic error will produce offsets in opposite directions. This parallax is the signal that is used to map topography from stereo imagery, but for ice flow mapping it isn't a good thing. It is also the case that topographic errors are much more common over rapidly flowing or rapidly melting ice than over any other land cover type.  There is a simple solution to this problem: **use images from the same orbit track** so that the topographic distortion is essentially the same in both images - this eliminates 95% of the issue.  For Landsat this means using image pairs with the same path and row designations. For Sentinel 2 there is a similar "track" in the metadata, but the easiest approach is to use images separated by multiples of 5 days - so a 5 day S2A x S2B pair, or a 10 day S2A x S2A or S2B x S2B pair (Sentinel 2 A and B are in 10-day repeat orbits, staggered 5 days apart).
